== Steps

=== file

I always start with `file` out of habit:

----
$ file crack_5
crack_5: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=1d57b761520e76af90103e540405284c7e8ffeee, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
----

Confirmed itâ€™s a 64-bit ELF unstripped binary.

=== strings

Ran `strings` to look for hardcoded password:

----
$ strings Crackme-4
...
[]A\A]A^A_
Sorry, That Is Wrong.
Please Try Again.
Password: 
Correct
Sorry, That's Wrong...
;*3$"
zPLR
...
----

No obvious password found.


=== Running

I ran the binary but all I got was *terminated by signal SIGSEGV (Address boundary error)*.

Then I wondered if this challenge was meant to patch the binary.
Or maybe it's something that required arguments.

I tried running with 1 argument, I still got *SIGSEGV*.
I then try with 2 arguments.

.Running with 2 arguments
image::Crack_5/1-2args.png["Running with 2 arguments"]

This looked promising.
So I tried with 3 arguments, then 4, then 5, then so on and on...
But the result is still the same.

I just need 2 arguments.

=== Disassembler

I opened Ghidra's disassembler only to find out that the **main** function takes **2** parameters.

[,c]
----
undefined4 main(undefined8 param_1,long param_2)
----

Reading through the code, there were only two things that were important.

**First**, is the ``args()`` function that takes two parameters.

[,c]
----
is_correct = args(*(char **)(param_2 + 8),*(char **)(param_2 + 16));
----

**Second**, is the for loops of ``fake_password`` and ``coded_password``.

I noticed that ``fake_password`` was not ever used in anything.


[,c]
----
for (i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) {
   decrypt((uint *)fake_password,5);
   decrypt((uint *)coded_password,5);
}
for (j = 0; j < 7; j = j + 1) {
   encrypt((uint *)coded_password,5);
   decrypt((uint *)fake_password,5);
   encrypt((uint *)fake_password,5);
}
for (k = 0; k < 1; k = k + 1) {
   decrypt((uint *)fake_password,5);
   decrypt((uint *)coded_password,5);
}
----

NOTE: I have already renamed the labels in Ghidra, but the actual binary string labels are different.

The value of ``is_correct`` must be set to **`**.

.Check condition before executing the rest of the code
[,c]
----
if (is_correct == '\x01') { ... }
----

Hence, I need to figure out how ``args()`` function work.

=== What is args() function?

.First 8 lines of args()
[,c]
----
undefined8 args(char *param_1,char *param_2)
{
  size_t temp;
  basic_ostream *pbVar1;
  undefined8 is_correct;
  basic_string sorry_thats_wrong [39];
  allocator<char> local_21;
  int len_arg_2;
  int len_arg_1;
...
----

The first thing I have noticed is that the length of the two parameters were saved and checked.

.Length of the two parameters were checked
[,c]
----
temp = strlen(param_1);
len_arg_1 = (int)temp;
temp = strlen(param_2);
len_arg_2 = (int)temp;
if (len_arg_1 == 8) {
   if (len_arg_2 == 8) {
...
----

This is the overall conditional branch of the function.

[,c]
----
if (len_arg_1 == 8) { <.>
   if (len_arg_2 == 8) { <.>
   pbVar1 = std::operator<<((basic_ostream *)std::cout,sorry_thats_wrong);
   std::operator<<(pbVar1,'\n');
   is_correct = 0;
   }
   else if (param_2[len_arg_2 - 2] == 'X') {
   if (*param_2 < 'Y') {
      pbVar1 = std::operator<<((basic_ostream *)std::cout,sorry_thats_wrong);
      std::operator<<(pbVar1,'\n');
      is_correct = 0;
   }
   else {
      is_correct = 1;
   }
   }
   else {
   pbVar1 = std::operator<<((basic_ostream *)std::cout,sorry_thats_wrong);
   std::operator<<(pbVar1,'\n');
   is_correct = 0;
   }
}
else {
                  /* try { // try from 0010181d to 001018cf has its CatchHandler @ 00101906 */
   pbVar1 = std::operator<<((basic_ostream *)std::cout,sorry_thats_wrong);
   std::operator<<(pbVar1,'\n');
   is_correct = 0;
}
----
<.> Returns incorrect if length of your first argument is not 8
<.> Returns incorrect if length of your first argument is exactly 8

If the length of the first argument where to be 8 characters, the code proceeds to check if the length of the second parameter is not equal to 8 characters.

This means, we need to have our first and second argument of the binary when executed be exactly 8 characters long and not 8 characters long, respectively.

There is another requirement, our second parameter must contain character ``X`` 4th index and the 1st index must be a character value greater than or equal ``Y``.

.Requirements for the 2nd parameter
[,c]
----
if (param_2[len_arg_2 - 2] == 'X') {
   if (*param_2 < 'Y') {
      pbVar1 = std::operator<<((basic_ostream *)std::cout,sorry_thats_wrong);
      std::operator<<(pbVar1,'\n');
      is_correct = 0;
   }
   else {
      is_correct = 1;
   }
...
}
----

These requirements are needed to return a value of ``1``.

.Return variable of args()
[,c]
----
return is_correct;
----

At this point, I now know what I need:

* The first argument of the binary must be **8 characters** long regardless of the characters used.
* The second argument of teh binary must have these conditions:
** 1st index must have integer value higher than ``Y``.
** 4th index must exactly be character **X**.

With this, I came up with a new way to execute the binary: ``./crack_5 12345678 Y00X0``

Well, I can just use ``./crack_5 12341234 YXX``, a shorter version of the 2nd argument.

That is because ``if (param_2[len_arg_2 - 2] == 'X')`` checks if the index of (length - 2) is exactly **X**.

=== Running with the correct parameters

Here, I ran the binary with the correct parameters.

.Running with the correct arguments
image::Crack_5/2-password.png["Running with the correct arguments"]

Now, I need to get the password.

That should not be a problem because there is a hint.

.Password hint
[,c]
----
copy_string(coded_password,20,copied_password);
is_password_correct = std::operator!=(password,copied_password);
----

=== Extracting the encrypted password

``coded_password`` is stored in the **.data** section of the binary.

.Encrypted password bytes
image::Crack_5/3-encrypted_pw.png["Encrypted password bytes"]

But how do we get the unencrypted password?

The easiest way is to use **GDB**!
Well, my other method was to decrypt it by rewriting the ``decrypt()`` function...
Although I had issues with that as it _took me almost 4 hours to realize the size of "pointers" and variables_.

=== GDB

I ran the binary with GDB and added a breakpoint somewhere around ``copy_string`` variable.

----

...

gefâž¤  b *main+537

----

I ran the binary with its arguments and was able to find the decrypted string.


.Running GDB with arguments
image::Crack_5/4-unc_pw.png["Running GDB with arguments"]

There we go, found the password.

.Found the unencrypted password
image::Crack_5/5-found_pw.png["Found the unencrypted password"]

It's ``P0iNT3R_tYPe5_M4tt3r``!

=== Using the correct password

.Testing the password found
image::Crack_5/6-test.png["Testing the password found"]

And that is all.

== Conclusion

This was a pretty easy challenge if you just used GDB directly like what I did above.

However, that's not going deeper down the rabbit hole of reverse engineering.

As I have mentioned earlier, it took me almost 4 hours to use the alternative solution...
Why that long?
You'll see below.

=== Manually decrypting the password

In the **main** funciton, ``decrypt((uint *)coded_password,5);`` was called 5, 7, and 1 times from the three loops.

This is what the **decrypt** function contains.

.decrypt() function
[,c]
----
void decrypt(uint *string,uint count)
{
  uint index;
  
  for (index = 0; index < count; index = index + 1) {
    string[(int)index] = index + string[(int)index];
    string[(int)index] = string[(int)index] + 0x23;
    string[(int)index] = string[(int)index] ^ 0xdeadbeef;
  }
  return;
}
----

It takes an input unsigned pointer of an array and an unsigned integer.
The string is the ``coded_password`` passed by calling the ``decrypt()`` function.

It then tries to loop over the array at the limit of ``count``.
Which is **5** called by the ``main()`` function.

Wait, why 5 when our ``coded_password`` is 20 characters long?

.coded_password
----
0x9c, 0x8e, 0xc4, 0x90, 0x97,
0x8d, 0xff, 0x81, 0x76, 0xe7,
0xfd, 0xbb, 0xb4, 0xe1, 0xe0,
0xea, 0x74, 0xca, 0x9e, 0xac
----

And it is stored as **1 byte** in an array.

See the image below again for reference.

image::Crack_5/3-encrypted_pw.png["Encrypted password bytes"]

At first, I thought the loop will iterate over the array **1 byte** at a time.
And been trying to figure out why when the code below is already able to decrypt the password.

[,c]
----
for (i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) {
   decrypt((uint *)fake_password,5);
   decrypt((uint *)coded_password,5);
}
----

That's where 3 to 4 hours worth of my time got wasted trying to figure out why the hell it gets decrypted properly.
At first I thought the memory doesn't get cleared since **decrypt** function was called 5 times so ``index`` must have been running...

Which was wrong.
My thought process was wrong.

There was already a big hint right in front of me: ***uint***

An **unsigned integer**.

Well, other than that, there's also ``string[(int)index] = index + string[(int)index];``: **(int)index**.

What does this mean?
Majority of the people would have already seen this as pretty obvious.
Not for me.


=== Solution + Python script

The reason why it works is becuse accessing the index at a given pointer address of an array is by **4 bytes**.
Ahah!

So, what happens is that 4 bytes were decrypted each time the loop iterates.

.The actual data being decrypted each iteration.

----

Now that makes sense!

I asked ChatGPT to help me create a Python script to decrypt the password.

[, python]
----
def decrypt(data, count):
    """
    data: list of 32-bit unsigned integers (uint32)
    count: number of uint32s to process
    """
    for index in range(count):
        data[index] = (index + data[index]) & 0xFFFFFFFF  # simulate 32-bit overflow
        data[index] = (data[index] + 0x23) & 0xFFFFFFFF
        data[index] = (data[index] ^ 0xDEADBEEF) & 0xFFFFFFFF


def bytes_to_uint32_list(byte_data):
    """
    Convert bytes (len multiple of 4) to list of uint32 values
    """
    return [int.from_bytes(byte_data[i:i+4], 'little') for i in range(0, len(byte_data), 4)]

def uint32_list_to_bytes(uint_list):
    return b''.join(x.to_bytes(4, 'little') for x in uint_list)

coded_password_bytes = bytes([
    0x9c, 0x8e, 0xc4, 0x90, 0x97, 0x8d, 0xff, 0x81,
    0x76, 0xe7, 0xfd, 0xbb, 0xb4, 0xe1, 0xe0, 0xea,
    0x74, 0xca, 0x9e, 0xac
])

coded_password = bytes_to_uint32_list(coded_password_bytes)

# Process first 5 uint32s
decrypt(coded_password, 5)

# Show result
print("Decrypted uint32s:")
for val in coded_password:
    print(f"{val:08x}")

# If you want to see it as bytes:
decrypted_bytes = uint32_list_to_bytes(coded_password)
print("Decrypted bytes:", decrypted_bytes)
----

Running the script gave me the needed password of this challenge.
