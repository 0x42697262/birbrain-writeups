What to expect?

. A stripped GUI binary
. A type of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem[Constraint satisfaction problem]
. No Anti-Debugging

== Steps

=== file

I always start with `file` out of habit:

----
$ file keypad 
keypad: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=cbb1c416b7663436b715621f209e58ac8b02f042, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped
----

A stripped binary this time.

=== strings

Ran `strings` to look for hardcoded password:

----
$ strings keypad
...
[]A\A]A^A_
clicked
Delete
Confirm
KEYPAD
destroy
Well Done
That's Unfortunate...
;*3$"
...
----

Looks empty.


=== Running

Since this is my first GUI app, I'll try running to see what it does.

Oh, it's a vault.
I thought it's a calculator.

Looks like putting the correct PIN sequence is the goal.

=== Figuring out the decompiled code

I tried reverse engineering with https://github.com/radareorg/radare2[radare2] but it was quite confusing and it crashed when i tried ``pdg`` (second time).
So I went back to Ghidra :)

I kind like radare's decompiling but I don't quite understand assembly yet.

Since the binary is stripped from its labels, I didn't find the main function easily.
Went ahead and looked for the entry point and started from there.

Then I found the main function.

.main() function
image::d4rkfl0w-keypad/2-main.png[]

There was a lot to uncover.
I had to figure out which variables and functions that are related to graphics.
I had to ignore them.

After some reading and renaming the variables and functions, I noticed that each button corresponds to an action.

.Button actions
image::d4rkfl0w-keypad/3-actions.png[]

Each function contains an algorithm to manipulate the ``PIN``.

Such as **Button 4**:

.Button 4 PIN Manipulation Algorithm
image::d4rkfl0w-keypad/4-btn4.png[]

Each button action has different PIN calculation.

This makes me wonder where the PIN is used for.
Although one could already guess it's for successfully reverse engineering the binary.

There is a **Confirm** button and as expected it also contains a function that verifies the PIN:

.Verify PIN
image::d4rkfl0w-keypad/5-verify.png[]

The PIN value of the vault is ``0x1746e``.

_But where did the **PIN** come from?_

..data PIN
image::d4rkfl0w-keypad/6-pin.png[]

It's located (probably?) in the **.data** section of the binary as **8 bytes** uninitialized.

It's accessed by the functions of each numerical buttons (and a function that randomizes the value of the pin but never gets called).


=== Bruteforcing the PIN

At first, I thought I could use Z3 Theorem Prover but I had issues with it that signed values does not wrap-around.
It's a Python quirk and I never figured out how to implement wrapping around the maximum bytes.

Thus, I wrote this xref:attachment$d4rkfl0w-keypad/bruteforce.c[code] in C that will bruteforce the PIN.

Then I ran the code after compiling it.


.Cracked the PIN within a second
image::d4rkfl0w-keypad/7-cracked.png[]

Hooray!
I found the PIN!

Time to test it.

=== Checking the PIN

Ran the GUI application again and voila!

.Well Done

**Challenge complete.**

== Conclusion

This challenge would have only taken me at most 3 hours if not for the wrap-around issues.
Because in C/C++, when a variable exceeds the maximum data it holds, it goes all the way back to **0**.

If I had a **4-byte** integer with the value of **0xFFFFFE**, adding **0x12** will result it to **0x00000010**.

This does not happen in Python.
Nor I could figure out how to implement this in Z3.
[.line-through]#Although the wrap-around worked sometime that I probably didn't notice, there's also an issue with modulo arithmetic and I decided to not deal with it. Also bruteforcing was almost in an instant so there's that.#
