== Steps

=== file

I always start with `file` out of habit:

----
$ file Crackme-4
Crackme-4: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=4aef34e93a282bc5d5be68cd1319c78b63a55b0e, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
----

Confirmed itâ€™s a 64-bit ELF unstripped binary.

=== strings

Ran `strings` to look for hardcoded password:

----
$ strings Crackme-4
...
GLIBCXX_3.4
u/UH
[]A\A]A^A_
Sorry that is incorrect.
Please enter the password: 
That's CORRECT, Well Done.
;*3$"
GCC: (Debian 9.2.1-4) 9.2.1 20190821
...
----

No obvious password found.

=== Ghidra

Loaded in Ghidra.  
Noticed many functions (e.g. `c0()` to `c9()`) being used to build the password inside `buildPassword()`.  
Realized the password was assembled byte-by-byte.  

I considered recreating the logic of all these functions (e.g. writing a python script to simulate them) but decided it would be too tedious.
Not to mention, I don't want to do this method when it scales up to thousands of functions.

=== GDB + GEF

Opened GDB with GEF and ran the binary.

Started checking each `cX()` return value.

Then, I noted down the return values to manually piece together the password.

In addition, I tried altering the comparison checks:

* Set breakpoints on `cmp` instructions after each `cX()` call.
* Used: ``set $bl = $al`` to force my input byte to match expected values.

I was able to get these values from the cX() functions:

----
c3() = 0x3a
c0() = 0x55
c1() = 0x36
c2() = 0x2d
c4() = 0x59
c8() = 0x2b
c5() = 0x4c
c6() = 0x2e
c7() = 0x22
c9() = ??
----

Which is just ``U6-:YL."+\`` but I missed the function **c9()** and the character for it was ``/``.

=== Running with the correct password

And that's how I painstakingly got the password...

=== What I should have done

After seeing the disassembly of ``Vault::checkPassword()``:

<.> Breakpoint here

I could've just set a breakpoint at *_ZN5Vault13checkPasswordEv+24* then inspected the value of ``$rdi``.

I ran gdb again.

----

Entered a random password and gdb will pause at the breakpoint I have set earlier.

image::Crackme-4/2-breakpoint.png["GDB+GEF Breakpoint"]

Then finally print out the password with ``x/s 0x000055555556bad0``:

image::Crackme-4/3-print.png["Print Password"]

Although, there is no need to print it out since the password can already be seen in **$rdi** register.

Okay, maybe I was wrong earlier about needing ``/`` since after the ``+`` symbol is a newline character.

Although for some reason, it still accepted with or without ``/`` as the final character.
