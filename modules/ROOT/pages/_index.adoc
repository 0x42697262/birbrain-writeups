= Writeups
:page-aliases: root, home

Welcome, this is where I store my writeups for various challenges such as Wargames, Capture The Flags, Pwn boxes, and etc!!

Currently, I am playing:

. xref:HackTheBox:_index.adoc[HackTheBox]
. xref:PicoCTF:_index.adoc[PicoCTF]
. xref:TryHackMe:_index.adoc[TryHackMe]
. xref:Root-Me:_index.adoc[Root-Me]

== Writeup Format

My writeups are and will all be written in AsciiDoc format, unless I will have to change to something else again in the future (but I doubt I will).
