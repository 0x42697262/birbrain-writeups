== Introduction

.Challenge Description
****
An authenticated file exchange achieved through FTP. Recover the password used by the user.
****

A packet capture file of FTP packets is provided.

== Methodology

== Reconnaissance

Check the file type.

----
$ file ch1.pcap
ch1.pcap: Unicode text, UTF-16, little-endian text, with CRLF line terminators
----

Everything is just a bunch of string... of packets.

Use ``Wireshark`` for this.

== Acquiring The Password

FTP by itself is insecure because it's not encrypted.

=== Using Wireshark

The password can easily be taken by scrolling and manually inspecting each packets for the FTP password.

On packet #11, the password is present.

Instead of manually scrolling for the password, a better approach is to use ``TShark``.

Or simply use the search bar: ``ftp.request.command == PASS``.

=== Using TShark

This can easily be accomplished by doing either of these commands:

. ``tshark -r ch1.pcap -Y 'ftp.request.command == "PASS"'``
. ``tshark -r ch1.pcap | grep 'Request: PASS'``

----
11   7.639420 10.20.144.150 â†’ 10.20.144.151 FTP 81 Request: PASS cdts3500
----

The `-Y` flag sets the display filter of Wireshark.


== Challenge Summaries

Execute ``tshark -r ch1.pcap -Y 'ftp.request.command == "PASS"'`` to grab the password.

== Lessons Learned

. Packet capture analysis (basic)
. Wireshark
. TShark
. FTP is unencrypted communication
. When sending a password, FTP uses ``Request: PASS``

== Conclusion

That was very simple yet I did not have enough knowledge on how to use Wireshark or TShark best features.
If it were not for these tools, I would've manually scanned each packets.

So, use Wireshark when it's a packet file, okay?
