== Information

**Deploy & hack into a Windows machine, leveraging common misconfigurations issues.**

This machine is vulnerable to https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue/[MS17-010 EternalBlue SMB Remote Windows Kernel Pool Corruption] exploit.
Disclosed on March 14, 2016.

EternalBlue exploits a flaw in SMBv1 (and partially SMBv2) where specially crafted packets can trigger remote code execution without authentication.
Once exploited, it allows an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim machine, essentially gaining full control.

This was used by WannaCry and NotPeya.

This box is quite nice for teaching the basics of pwning.
Hopefully, this writeup is enough to teach anyone.

== Task 1) Recon

First, I want to get information about the machine.
Mostly, everyone uses xref:知識:ROOT:nmap.adoc[nmap] to scan the machine for online hosts, open ports, and discover services.

The full scan command is:

----
# nmap -sS -sV -O -T5 --script=vuln --traceroute 10.10.5.211 -oN blue.nmap
----

Oh, **nmap** requires root privileges.

The explanation of each argument is listed below:

* ``-sS``: Performs a **SYN (stealth) scan** to check for open ports without completing full TCP handshakes.
* ``-sV``: Attempts to **detect service versions** on open ports to identify specific software.
* ``-O``: Enables **OS detection** to guess the target’s operating system based on responses.
* ``-T5``: Uses **maximum speed (insane timing)** for faster scanning but with higher chance of detection.
* ``--script=vuln``: Runs **vulnerability detection scripts** to check for known issues (e.g. MS17-010).
* ``--traceroute``: Traces the **network path (hops)** to the target to map network routes.
* ``10.10.5.211``: Specifies the **target IP address** to scan.
* ``-oN blue.nmap``: Saves the **output in normal format** to a file named `blue.nmap`.

As for the reason why I used ``-T5``, that's because I did not care about the machine.
If it were to be in a real life situation, I probably want the timing to be the lowest value to avoid getting detected.

The machine is also highly vulnerable.

----

**ms17-010** is a vulnerability known as **EternalBlue**.
Some quick search online is enough to give me brief description of it.

== Task 2) Gain Access

Now that I know the type of vulnerability the machine has, I can fire up **metasploitable**.

To be honest, I don't really like the method of just using existing tools then exploit a system only to call it "hacking".
But for the sake of learning the basics, I'll be doing exactly that.
Researching about EternalBlue is still outside my skill level.

First, start metasploit.

.Running msfconsole
image::blue/1-msfconsole.png[]

Then I searched for the exploit in metasploit.

.Searching for ms17-010
image::blue/2-search.png[]

There are a total of 29 modules to choose from.
I chose the most basic one, module **#0**.

.Using exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
image::blue/3-use.png[]

Before I can start running the exploit, I need to set some options first.
This can be done by running ``show options``.

.Showing options
image::blue/4-show.png[]

Notice that there are 4 required options.
3 of those has already been configured by default, but **RHOSTS** is missing.

This is our target host, the remote machine's IP address.
My remote machine's IP address is **10.10.5.211**.

So, I set the value of **RHOSTS** to **10.10.5.211**.

.Set RHOSTS
image::blue/5-rhosts.png[]

Wait, before I start executing the exploit, I need to double check the **LHOST** (local host, my attacker machine, me, whoami, bird, whatever) otherwise the exploit would not work.
This is something I had to figure out why my exploit didn't work before.

Currently, the value of **LHOST** is not configured properly.
Since I am using OpenVPN, I need to set the IP address accordingly.

Wait!
One last more.

Before executing, the current payload of meterpreter is set to ``windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`` by default.
I need to set it manually as practice.

.Set payload
image::blue/6-payload.png[]

Finally, I can run the exploit!


.Exploit failed
image::blue/7-exploit_fail.png[]

Errrr..... The exploit has failed... Anyways, not a problem.

Based on the log, **port 4444** is already in use.
Most likely because I had previous metasploit shell running and didn't terminate it properly.
I just need to set the **LPORT** to something else then rerun the exploit.

.Exploit Success!
image::blue/8-exploit_success.png[]

And by gambling, the exploit should be a success!

== Task 3) Escalate

Currently, my shell has no system privilege.
That can be upgraded by going back to meterpreter by hitting ``^Z`` and run the ``shell_to_meterpreter`` module.

.Upgrading privileges
image::blue/9-upgrade.png[]

This is how to run the ``shell_to_meterpreter`` module.

.Using shell_to_meterpreter module and changing session
image::blue/10-modules.png[]

After this,I need to change the **SESSION** option.

A list of sessions can be viewed by running ``sessions list``.

.Showing sessions lists
image::blue/11-list.png[]

Set the session to **1** and exploit.

.Set session
image::blue/12-session.png[]

Finally, use the newly created session.

.Use session 2
image::blue/13-use.png[]

Now, I need to upgrade my shell to **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM** since that has higher privileges.
Even though my current shell is already **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**.

.Show processes to migrate
image::blue/14-ps.png[]

Migrating to a process is a gamble.
Sometimes it works.
Sometimes it fails.

I just need to find some process that the shell can migrate to.

.Migration
image::blue/15-migrate.png[]

Luckily, it only took me 2 tries.
Well, I have an inkling on what kind of process to touch or not but I can't really put evidence to it yet.

== Task 4) Cracking

Here's the most tedious part, cracking hashes!
Especially if it's in the real world since no dictionary can ever grab your password if it's unique.

But this is a practice lobby so dictionaries is the key.

Simply run ``hashdump`` and get the hashes.

.hashdump
image::blue/16-hashdump.png[]

After that, save it to a file and bruteforce the hashes.

.Using John The Ripper to bruteforce
image::blue/17-john.png[]

Finally got the password of the user: ``alqfna22``.

== Task 5) Find flags!

I am a lazy person.
I do not like manually finding the flags on directories I am not familiar with.

Luckily, MS-DOS has regex search.
And I already know the flag's filename format: **flag*.txt**

.regex search
----
dir C:\ /s /b | findstr "flag.*\.txt"   
----

Make sure to run ``shell`` in meterpreter shell first.
After that, execute the search!

.Using REGEX search for the flag.
image::blue/18-regex.png[]

I found 3 files that's named ``flag1.txt``, ``flag2.txt``, and ``flag3.txt``.

To print each flags, simply run ``type <filename>`` and that's it.

== Conclusion

This challenge is very simple, it was very fun to be able to learn new things.
This writeup intends as my note for the future.

Some parts were skipped or glossed over, and some doesn't even have proper explanation why such tool is used instead of another one.
Let's just say it's for the sake of experiencing new and learning something new.
