== Solution

I always tend to check the file type with ``file`` command.
It doesnt do much but makes me feel I get a foothold or something.

I noticed there's ``pygame`` indicating this might be a compiled Python game using pygame.
Although I do not know how tool is being used to compile the code.

There's four possible tools used to package this game:

. PyInstaller
. cx_Freeze
. Nuitka
. py2exe (but this is for windows)

=== Running

But I haven't even opened the game yet.
So, I ran it and see what it does.

.Playing the game
image::rev_tinyplatformer/1-play.png[]

It looks like  simple game.
I thought the controls were **WASD** but it turns out to be arrow keys and the space bar.

7 seconds was plenty of time to complete each level.
There were 3 levels in total.

.Winning
image::rev_tinyplatformer/2-win.png[]

Time to close the game since there were no print statements in the console.
I only saw the word **pygame** and the Python version used.

.Terminal output
image::rev_tinyplatformer/3-console.png[]

=== Checking for the tool used to package

I need to know how it's being compiled so first I checked for PyInstaller indicators using ``strings`` again.

----

----

Those ``pyi-``, ``pyimod``, and ``pyi-runtime`` strings tells me:

* The Python code is embedded in a PyInstaller archive inside that ELF.
* The code is most likely in **.pyc** (compiled Python) format inside a PYZ archive.

I don't know what tool to decompile **PyInstaller** so I looked it up online and found https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor[pyinstxtractor].

=== Extracting with pyinstxtractor

After cloning the repository, I ran it and got the extracted python compiled files.

Cool!
Here's all the extracted files.
Although I just need the script.

It's either on ``main.pyc`` or ``struct.pyc``.
I bet it's on the **main** python script.

<.> Probably the entire game

Next is I need to figure out how to decompile the compiled python script.
Quick searches online gave me 3 options:

. https://github.com/rocky/python-decompile3[decompile3]
. https://github.com/zrax/pycdc[pycdc]
. https://github.com/rocky/python-uncompyle6[uncompyle6]

I checked **decompile3** first and noticed it was good enough.

I didn't stop there so I checked **pycdc** as well.
Although I still need to compile it since it's written in C++, so I skipped it.

I checked **uncompyle6** as well, which is written by the same person of **decompile3**, and it turns out **decompile3** is the refactored version of **uncompyle6**.
I can choose either of the two but went with **uncompyle6** because it's recently been updated compared to months of no updates for **decompile3**.

=== Decompiling with uncompyle6

I ran **uncompyle6** to ``main.pyc``.

----
$ uncompyle6 main.pyc > main.py
----

This outputs the source code into a file.


=== Reading the source code of main.py

[NOTE]
====
The decompiled source code of ``main.py`` can be downloaded xref:attachment$rev_tinyplatformer/main.py[here].
====

It took me some time, probably an hour, to understand the flow of the code.
To skip some headaches explaining my experience, the code below is what's needed to grab the flag of this challenge.

.Flag part of the game
[,python]
----
secret_flag = False
if self.win:
    ...
    secrets = [
      [self.player.secret[i] for i in range(6)]]
    secrets += [[self.player.secret[i] for i in range(6, 11)]]
    secrets += [[self.player.secret[i] for i in range(11, len(self.player.secret))]]
    secrets = [secrets[0][0] > secrets[0][2], secrets[0][1] < secrets[0][4], secrets[0][2] > secrets[0][5], secrets[0][3] > secrets[0][4], secrets[0][5] > secrets[0][3],
      secrets[1][0] > secrets[1][4], secrets[1][1] < secrets[1][4], secrets[1][2] < secrets[1][3], secrets[1][3] < secrets[1][1],
      secrets[2][0] > secrets[2][1], secrets[2][2] < secrets[2][1], secrets[2][2] > secrets[2][3]]
    secret_flag = secret_flag not in secrets
...
if secret_flag:
    key = "".join([str(x) for x in self.player.secret]).encode()
    ciph = b'}dvIA_\x00FV\x01A^\x01CoG\x03BD\x00]SO'
    flag = bytes((ciph[i] ^ key[i % len(key)] for i in range(len(ciph)))).decode()
----

I deleted some parts of the code that's not needed.

The encrypted flag is stored in ``ciph`` variable.
The key is based from the collected **COLLECTIBLES**'s index encoded as a byte string.
The flag is stored in ``flag`` variable.

The collectibles are the ones the players collect in the game.

Here's what I found out after reading the source code:

self.player.secret:: A list of integers forming the index of the collected COLLECTIBLES.
collectibles:: Object the player collects in the game.
secrets:: A group of lists containing the indexes of collectibles and transforms into a boolean lists.
secret_flag:: A check if **secrets** are all **True** that satisfies the conditions of secrets.

So, the flow goes like this:

.Diagram Flow of Flag
[plantuml, format="svg"]
----
@startuml
start

if (self.win?) then (yes)
  :Split self.player.secret into 3 groups;
  :Apply constraints;
  :Evaluate constraints;
  :Set secret_flag;
else (no)
  stop
endif

if (secret_flag?) then (yes)
  :Build key from self.player.secret;
  :XOR ciph with key;
  :Decode flag;
else (no)
  stop
endif

stop
@enduml
----

For each group in the list, there is a corresponding constraint.

.1st Group
----
secrets[0][0] > secrets[0][2]
secrets[0][1] < secrets[0][4]
secrets[0][2] > secrets[0][5]
secrets[0][3] > secrets[0][4]
secrets[0][5] > secrets[0][3]
----

.2nd Group
----
secrets[1][0] > secrets[1][4]
secrets[1][1] < secrets[1][4]
secrets[1][2] < secrets[1][3]
secrets[1][3] < secrets[1][1]
----

.3rd Group
----
secrets[2][0] > secrets[2][1]
secrets[2][2] < secrets[2][1]
secrets[2][2] > secrets[2][3]
----

Once the constraints are applied, ``secrets`` (which is a list of booleans) should all be **True**.
Otherwise, our decryption key is incorrect.

=== Finding the Secret key

There are two ways to acquire the list of indexes.

First is to modify the source code and add a print statement when the game ends.
Second is to sort the ``COLLECTIBLES`` based on its Y-coordinate.

I did the first method and was able to get this.

.Secret key (but doesn't decode the ciphertext)
----
[0, 4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 0, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3, 0, 2, 1]
----

[, python]
----
COLLECTIBLES = [
 [ (316, 465), (337, 210), (731, 39), (534, 117), (222, 391), (554, 346) ],
 [ (380, 415), (417, 252), (570, 138), (197, 316), (358, 65) ],
 [ (164, 289), (567, 50), (371, 144), (461, 442) ]
]
----

**COLLECTIBLES** is just a list of tuples that contains two items, **X** and **Y** coordinates.

.Unsorted COLLECTIBLES
----
0 (316, 465)
1 (337, 210)
2 (731, 39)
3 (534, 117)
4 (222, 391)
5 (554, 346)

0 (380, 415)
1 (417, 252) 
2 (570, 138) 
3 (197, 316)
4 (358, 65)

0 (164, 289)
1 (567, 50)
2 (371, 144)
3 (461, 442)
----

When these are sorted based on its Y-coordinate (the 2nd index), I was able to obtain the following:

.Sorted COLLECTIBLES
----
2 (731, 39)
3 (534, 117)
1 (337, 210)
5 (554, 346)
4 (222, 391)
0 (316, 465)

4 (358, 65)
2 (570, 138) 
1 (417, 252) 
3 (197, 316)
0 (380, 415)

1 (567, 50)
2 (371, 144)
0 (164, 289)
3 (461, 442)
----

But this returns: ``[2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 0, 4, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3]``.
So it's **wrong**.

Wait, notice that it's reversed for each group.
Ah, now that makes sense.

That's because of how PyGame works: Y-axis grows downwards.

So, the actual sorted COLLECTIBLES looks like this:

.Correct Sorted COLLECTIBLES
----
0 (316, 465)
4 (222, 391)
5 (554, 346)
1 (337, 210)
3 (534, 117)
2 (731, 39)

0 (380, 415)
3 (197, 316)
1 (417, 252) 
2 (570, 138) 
4 (358, 65)

3 (461, 442)
0 (164, 289)
2 (371, 144)
1 (567, 50)
----

=== Finding the correct order of the key

Now, I should be able to decrypt the ciphertext to obtain the flag!

Except all I got is ``MPCxrm0ug3um1q^w7wu3oc|`` which is very far from HackTheBox's flag format.

Well, that's because I forced my way to decrypt the ciphertext even though the order was incorrect.

When the constraints was applied, ``secrets`` contained at least one value of **False**.

Using the given key results to this check:

.Key: [0, 4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 0, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3, 0, 2, 1]
----
[False, False, True, False, True, False, True, True, True, True, False, True]
----

I didn't want to manually find the constraints so I asked ChatGPT to solve it for me.
#In hindsight, I should've used Microsft Z3, a SAT solver.#

Anyways, I got the key.

.Correct key order
----
[5, 0, 4, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 0, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0]
----

Which resulted everything into **True**!

=== Obtaining the Flag

I made a snippet of code from the game and only taking the code that's involved in obtaining the flag.

.Code to decrypt the flag
[,python]
----
secret_flag = False
secret = [5, 0, 4, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 0, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0]
secrets = [[secret[i] for i in range(6)]]
secrets += [[secret[i] for i in range(6, 11)]]
secrets += [[secret[i] for i in range(11, len(secret))]]
secrets = [
    secrets[0][0] > secrets[0][2], secrets[0][1] < secrets[0][4], secrets[0][2] > secrets[0][5], secrets[0][3] > secrets[0][4], secrets[0][5] > secrets[0][3],
    secrets[1][0] > secrets[1][4], secrets[1][1] < secrets[1][4], secrets[1][2] < secrets[1][3], secrets[1][3] < secrets[1][1],
    secrets[2][0] > secrets[2][1], secrets[2][2] < secrets[2][1], secrets[2][2] > secrets[2][3]
]
secret_flag = secret_flag not in secrets
key = "".join([str(x) for x in secret]).encode()
ciph = b'}dvIA_\x00FV\x01A^\x01CoG\x03BD\x00]SO'
flag = bytes((ciph[i] ^ key[i % len(key)] for i in range(len(ciph)))).decode()
print(flag)

**Challenge complete.**


== Conclusion

This is a pretty nice challenged.
I thought I would have a harder time figuring out how to grab the flag.
Thought that I'd need to keep playing the game or have to spam print statements everywhere.

Turns out, I just need to properly understand the code.
And that's how I captured this challenge.

Although, I should've thought of using https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3[Z3 Theorem Prover] from Microsoft Research.
Oh well, let's just say it's a good experience and at least now know what to use next time.
