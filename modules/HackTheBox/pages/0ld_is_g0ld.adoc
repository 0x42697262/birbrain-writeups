== Solution

I always tend to check the file type with ``file`` command even though it is not necessary here.

----
$ file 0ld_is_g0ld.zip
0ld is g0ld.pdf: PDF document, version 1.6, 1 page(s) (zip deflate encoded)
----

It's a PDF file and there's a "zip" word in it... could it be an archive?
I'll try using ``strings``.

=== Gathering for possible string passwords

Okay, nevermind that.
It's mostly gibberish.

What about ``exiftool``?

Nothing.
Seems like I need to bruteforce the password.

=== Cracking the password

I tried https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk[binwalk] but I didn't see any binary.

I need a tool to bruteforce this PDF.
Some quick search online gave me https://github.com/mufeedvh/pdfrip[pdfrip].

Quite time consuming to compile in Rust though.

Alright, I was able to make it work.

----
$ pdfrip -n 12 -f '0ld is g0ld.pdf' wordlist ~/rockyou.txt
----

But this takes so much time.

.pdfrip takes too much time to crack

So, I moved to using ``pdf2john`` and ``john``.

.Extract password hash from PDF
----
$ pdf2john '0ld is g0ld.pdf' > pdf.hash
----

.Crack with john
----
$ john pdf.hash --wordlist=~/rockyou.txt
----

.Show cracked password
----
$ john --show pdf.hash
----

.Cracking with john

Ah, the password is ``jumanji69``.

=== Finding the Flag

Time to open the PDF document.

.Samuel Morse
image::0ld_is_g0ld/3-samuel.png[]

I do not know this guy.
Also where is the flag?

Ah, it's at the very bottom of the document.

.Morse Code (flag)
----
.-. .---- .--. ... .- -- ..- ...-- .-.. -- ----- .-. ... ...--
----

Converting this to plaintext from morse code gave me the flag.

**Challenge solved.**

== Conclusion

I learned a new tool in cracking PDFs that is quicker... Turns out it's still ``john`` (the ripper jumbo).
